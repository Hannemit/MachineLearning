# MachineLearning

This repository contains a collection of machine learning techniques. Right now there is not a lot of code yet but I am planning to add more interesting applications over time! 

## Directories

### Notes

Notes based on the Stanford University Machine Learning coursera course. These notes are still being updated and improved. I will add material outside of the course as a I learn more. 

### NeuralNets

A simple example of a fully connected neural network, implemented from scratch. The network is trained to recognise handwritten digits from the MNIst dataset. 

### LogisticRegression

Applying logistic regression to a simulated dataset. 

### Kmeans_GMM

There are two notebooks in this directory, one showing how K-means clustering works and how it is good for clustering isotropic dataclusters. The other notebook shows that K-means clustering fails to provide good results for anisotropic clusters, and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is implemented which performs much better.
